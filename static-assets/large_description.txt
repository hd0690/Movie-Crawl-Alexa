Movie Crawl is a skill to help you find information related to upcoming movies, which are releasing this week or coming weeks or you can even find the movies which are releasing on a specific date.

We are releasing many more features in the next version which would enable you to interact with a lot of good features, so stay tuned :slightly_smiling_face:

You can say:

"Alexa, open Movie Crawl"
"Alexa, start Movie Crawl"
"Alexa, launch Movie Crawl"
